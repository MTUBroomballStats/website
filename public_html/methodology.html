			<p>
			The rankings are computed through a system called the Bradley-Terry
			model, which is the same model used to compute the
			<a href="http://www.collegehockeynews.com/info/?d=krach">KRACH
			ratings</a> for college hockey
			(<a href="http://elynah.com/tbrw/tbrw.cgi?krach">details</a>). While
			this model is well-studied and very accurate at representing past
			results, there are a few problems with its application to Broomball
			at Michigan Tech, which are solved through the following
			modifications to the Bradley-Terry rating system.
			</p>

			<h3>Problem #1</h3>
			<p>
			Bradley-Terry only works within connected graphs; that is, when
			you can say A played B, who played C, who played D... in such a way
			that every team to be compared is included. This obviously is not
			the case in Broomball until playoffs have been totally completed.
			</p>

			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			Instead of apply the Bradley-Terry model to teams, it is applied to
			players. For every real game played between teams, the model treats
			it as a set of games between every possible matchup between the
			individual player participants. In this way, every player since 2005
			is connected to every other player since 2005 through a chain of "A
			played B, who played C, who played D...". This allows all players to
			be ranked against each other. Then team ratings are simply the
			arithmetic mean of their players.
			</p>

			<h3>Problem #2</h3>
			<p>
			A team of all bad players with a single excellent player will appear
			to be a mediocre team through a simple arithmetic mean of its
			players, when in reality, a bad team with a single great player will
			only be slightly better than without that player.
			</p>

			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			Rather than a straight average of its players' ratings, each
			player's rating is weighted by 10 raised to the power of the
			absolute value its z-score, relative to the straight average of the
			team's players. This attenuates the effect of large outliers without
			excising them from the calculations entirely.
			</p>

			<h3>Problem #3</h3>
			<p>
			Any undefeated player will have an infinite rating.
			</p>

			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			Fractional wins are awarded based on margin of victory, which means
			a player is only truly "undefeated" if they have an infinte margin
			of victory. This process is described in more detail under
			Problem #4.
			</p>

			<h3>Problem #3</h3>
			<p>
			Bradley-Terry does not take margin of victory into account. In
			Broomball, this is not a good thing because margin of victory is
			generally a good indicator of the relative skill difference, and
			there should be rewards in the rankings for beating a team by a wide
			margin instead of squeaking by in overtime.
			</p>

			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			Players are awarded fractional "wins" derived according to the
			margin of victory. On the flip side, the losing players also receive
			fractional "wins" such that a total of one victory is given for any
			individual matchup. The exact formula used to calculate these
			victory points can be found
			<a href="http://www.theonlycolors.com/2010/6/9/1508422/margin-aware-bradley-terry-yet">
			here</a>. The k value I chose is 2.3, which means that a 2-goal
			margin equates to 0.73 "wins" for the winner and 0.27 "wins" for the
			loser. A 4-goal margin is worth 0.88 "wins", a 6-goal margin is
			worth 0.95 "wins", and a 10-goal margin is worth 0.993 "wins".
			</p>

			<h3>Problem #5</h3>
			<p>
			While the rating system allows players from all recorded Broomball
			seasons since 2005 to be ranked together, inter-generational
			rankings are heavily skewed toward players from older generations.
			This is because each player has a single rating computed from all
			games played. Suppose player A played broomball from 2008 to 2012
			and player B played from 2012 to 2016. Player B is now one of the
			best Broomball players at Tech, but started off as an inexperienced
			freshman. Player B now has many quality wins from his years playing
			Broomball at a rating to prove it. However, player A played B in
			2012 and easily beat him because of his inexperience. Now player A
			gets the big ratings bump from beating a very good player when in
			reality player B was a bad player when that game occurred. Similarly
			player B's rating will likely always be lower than player A's
			not only because player B lost to player A, but also because most of
			player B's classmates also lost to most of player B's classmates,
			meaning that even though player B may have beaten many of his
			classmates in later years, the entire generation is overall ranked
			lower than player A's generation. This is because Bradley-Terry
			assumes that there is no change in player skill over time. This
			assumption causes these inaccuraces to build up over time, resulting
			in players from 2005 always being ranked much higher than current
			players.
			</p>

			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			Each player is given a different rating for each year, which is 
			computed from all matchups that occurred during that year or the
			preceding years. When computing ratings from the list of matchups,
			the opponent's rating from that year is used in place, ensuring that
			there is no effect from years to follow on that matchup. This
			removes the bump to older players' ratings from beating younger
			players, but does nothing to address the depression to younger
			players' ratings.
			</p>
			<p>
			To solve the rating decay problem, an exponential regression
			analysis is run on the averages of all players for each season. It
			was determined experimentally that the correlation coefficient for
			this regression is typically greater than 0.99 (0.9985 for seasons
			2005 to 2016), making it useful for predictions and providing
			further evidence for a systemic bias against younger players. The
			exponential regression curve is then used to generate adjustment
			factors for each season such that when all player ratings are
			divided by the relevant season's adjustment factor, the average 
			rating for each season is near 100. However, using the regression
			curve to predict the adjustment factor rather than artificially
			forcing each season's average to be 100 allows for small random
			differences to occur between years as certain years may have overall
			better players than other years.
			</p>

			<h3>Problem #6</h3>
			<p>
			Player ratings are based on the total of that player's body of work.
			This can cause some inaccuracies in ratings for the current year if
			a good player always played on bad teams for whatever reason. Then,
			if a number of these good players from bad teams got together their
			senior year and had a really great team, that team could never
			overcome the effect of the previous years of broomball dragging
			their rating down even if they were one of the best teams in
			broomball that year.
			</p>

			<h4>Solution</h4>
			<p>
			Matchups are weighted by the formula (cy - fy + 1) where cy is the
			current year and fy is the first year the player played broomball.
			This allows a player's rating to reflect his growth in skill over
			time and places emphasis on the current broomball season.
