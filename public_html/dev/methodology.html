			The rankings are computed through a system called the Bradley-Terry
			model, which is the same model used to compute the KRACH ratings
			for college hockey. However, in order to get preseason ratings as
			well as individual player ratings, matchups are defined as between
			players rather than between teams. The team ratings are then
			computed as arithmetic means of their players, weighted by 10
			raised to the power of the absolute value of each player's z-score
			(standard score). This aggressive weighting scheme creates
			resistance to outliers that are orders of magnitude of the other
			players while allowing them to still have a tempered effect.
			<br /><br />
			More information about the KRACH system and its underlying
			Bradley-Terry model are available at the following websites:
