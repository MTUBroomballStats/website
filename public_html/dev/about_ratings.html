			The ratings are on an odds scale, meaning that if team A had a
			rating of 300 and team B had a rating of 100, team A would be
			expected to win 3/4 of all games between A and B. This can be
			generalized to all entities (players, teams, conferences, and
			leagues) by saying that if entity A has rating Ra and entity B has
			rating Rb, then entity A has probability Ra / (Ra + Rb) of winning
			any given matchup between entity A and entity B. In the example
			above, team A has a 75% chance of beating team B in a game.
			<br /><br />
			For more information on how these ratings are calculated, see the
			Methodology page found at the bottom of the rankings.
